- [ ] 1/2 cup Plain Greek Yogurt
- [ ] 2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (optional)
- [ ] 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- [ ] 3 large eggs
- [ ] 1 large egg yolk

1. Arrange a rack in the lower-middle position of the oven and heat to 375°F.
1. Take the blocks of cream cheese out of their boxes and let them come to room temperature on the counter.
1. Place the crust in the oven and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until the crust is fragrant and just starting to brown around the edges.
1. Let the crust cool on the stove while preparing the filling.
1. Lower the oven heat to 350°F.
1. Place the cream cheese, sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a food processor. Pulse until the mixture is creamy, like thick frosting, and no lumps of cream cheese remain.
1. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula.
1. Add the greek plain yogurt, lemon juice, and vanilla and pulse until combined and creamy.
1. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula.
1. Add the eggs and the yolk one at a time. Wait until the previous egg is just barely mixed into the batter before adding the next one. At first, the mixture will look clumpy and broken, but it will come together as the eggs are worked in.
1. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula.
1. Pour the batter over the cooled crust and spread it into an even layer.
1. Bring a few cups of water to a boil and pour the water into the roasting pan. being careful not to splash any water onto the cheesecake. Fill the pan to about an inch, or just below the lowest edge of foil.
1. Bake the cheesecake in a 9-inch cake pan for 55 to 60 minutes. The cheesecake is done when the outer two to three inches look slightly puffed and set, but the inner circle still jiggles (like Jell-O) when you gently shake the pan. Some spots of toasted golden color are fine, but if you see any cracks starting to form, move on to the next step right away.
1. Leave the cheesecake in the oven. Turn off the oven and crack the door open or prop it open with a wooden spoon. Let the cheesecake cool slowly for 1 hour.
1, Remove the cheesecake from the oven and from the water bath and place it on top of the stove. Run a thin-bladed knife around the edge of the cake to make sure it's not sticking to the sides (which can cause cracks as it cools). Let the cheesecake cool completely on the stove.
1. Chill the cheesecake, uncovered, for at least 4 hours or up to 3 days in the refrigerator. This step is crucial for letting the cheesecake set and achieving perfect cheesecake texture — don't rush it.
1. Take the cheesecake out of the refrigerator about 30 minutes before you plan to serve.

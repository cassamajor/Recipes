- [ ] 2 ½ cups whole wheat flour
- [ ] ½ cup olive oil
- [ ] 1 cup warm water

1. In the bowl of an electric mixer with the dough hooks attached, mix together the flour and oil for 2 minutes. If you don’t have any dough hooks, use normal mixing paddles.
2. While the mixer is still running, gradually pour in the water and continue mixing until the dough is smooth. This should take another 2 minutes.
3. Divide the dough into 10 equal pieces and roll each piece into a ball with your hands. Slightly flatten each ball with the palm of your hand and leave to rest on a baking tray for 20 minutes.
4. Heat a large skillet/frying pan over a medium-high heat. It needs to be really hot before you start cooking the dough.
5. Use a rolling pin to roll your tortillas into thin circles small enough to fit into your pan. Be careful not to add too much flour when rolling the tortillas out – excess flour will burn in the pan.
6. Pour a tiny amount of oil into the hot pan and spread it around with a piece of kitchen paper. With a spatula, carefully transfer one tortilla at a time into the pan and cook until puffy and slightly brown. Flip and cook on the other side until puffy and slightly brown. Cooking time takes 30-60 seconds per side. If any large air bubbles appear, pop them with a sharp knife. Keep your hands away from the scorching air that will escape.
7. Serve the tortillas immediately or leave to cool to room temperature before wrapping in plastic wrap and refrigerating or freezing.

# Cajun Chicken Pasta
> Hybrid of the [Chicken Breasts](/Chicken/Chicken_Breasts.md) and [Cajun Shrimp Pasta](/Lunch&Dinner/Cajun_Shrimp_Pasta.md) recipes.

- [ ] 1 tablespoon sea salt
- [ ] 16 ounces penne pasta
- [ ] 1 pound raw shrimp (deveined, cleaned, tail removed)
- [ ] 2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning
- [ ] 1 tablespoon olive oil
- [ ] 2 tablespoon butter
- [ ] 2 cup heavy cream
- [ ] 1 cup parmesan cheese

## Cook the chicken
1. Pound the chicken breasts to an even thickness with the bottom of a mason jar.
1. Combine chicken with cajun seasoning and olive oil in bowl. Toss to combine.
1. Heat a frying pan large enough to fit the chicken in a single layer over medium-high heat.
1. When it is quite hot, add the seasoned chicken. Cook undisturbed for just about 1 minute to help them get a little golden on one side (you are not actually searing or browning them).
1. Flip each chicken breast over.
1. Reduce the heat to low.
1. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid. Set a timer for 10 minutes, and walk away. Do not lift the lid; do not peek.
1. After 10 minutes have elapsed, turn off the heat. (If you have an electric stove, remove the pan from the heat.) Reset the timer for 10 minutes and leave the chicken breasts in the pan. Again, do not lift the lid; do not peek.
1. After the 10 minutes are up, uncover, and your chicken is done. Make sure there is no pink in the middle of the chicken breasts. If you want to be absolutely sure it is cooked, you can use an instant-read thermometer to check -- the chicken should be at least 165Â°F.
1. Once done cooking, transfer cooked chicken to a clean plate, and slice.

## Cook the pasta
1. While the chicken is cooking, cook the shrimp and sauce.
1. Add salt to pot of water and bring to a boil.
1. Cook pasta to al dente doneness.
1. Before draining, scoop out at least 1/2 cup of the cooking water. Drain pasta and set aside.

## Cook the sauce
1. Once chicken is done cooking, add butter to the empty pot and melt.
1. Add heavy cream to pan and scrape bottoms to release any food that is stuck to the bottom. Allow cream to bubble.
1. Reduce heat to low and stir in parmesan cheese to melt.
1. Add cooked pasta and chicken and stir to coat.
1. If sauce needs to be thinned, add pasta water, one tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is achieved.

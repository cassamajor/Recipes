# [Oven Roasted Broccoli](https://www.budgetbytes.com/perfect-oven-roasted-broccoli/)

- [ ] 2 lbs. broccoli 
- [ ] 2 Tbsp olive oil
- [ ] 1/2 tsp cajun seasoning

1. Preheat the oven to 400ÂºF. Wash and chop the broccoli into bite-sized florets.
2. Spread the florets out over a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper (you can skip the parchment if you want extra browning). Drizzle the olive oil over top, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss the broccoli until it is fully and evenly coated in oil.
3. Roast the broccoli for 20-25 minutes, or until it has achieved the level of browning you desire, stirring once after about 15 mintues of roasting. Total roasting time may vary depending on the size of your florets and the type of baking sheet used (darker surfaces brown faster).

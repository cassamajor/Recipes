- [ ] 1 ½ cup lite coconut milk
- [ ] 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar
- [ ] 1 cup whole wheat flour
- [ ] 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- [ ] ½ teaspoon baking soda
- [ ] ¼ teaspoon salt
- [ ] ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- [ ] 1 egg
- [ ] 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- [ ] 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- [ ] 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- [ ] 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

6. Cook for a few minutes, until you see little bubbles forming on the surface.
7. Flip the pancakes and cook for a couple minutes on the other side. If you peek underneath, the bottom should be golden brown.
8. Serve with butter, pure maple syrup, or sliced fruit. Enjoy!


1. In a 2-cup liquid measuring cup, combine the milk and vinegar. Stir to combine and let this homemade “buttermilk” mixture rest until it is lightly curdled, at least 5 minutes.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, sugar, and cinnamon.
3. To the buttermilk mixture, add the egg, melted butter, and vanilla. Whisk until thoroughly blended.
4. Whisk the wet mixture into the dry ingredients, and stir the two together until just barely mixed (a few small lumps are okay). 
   - You want any visible loose flour to be stirred in, but there should still be plenty of lumps. If you stir out the lumps, the pancakes will likely be tough.
5. Let the batter rest for 5 minutes so your pancakes will be nice and fluffy.
6. Meanwhile, preheat your skillet over medium-low heat.
7. Gently stir the batter one last time.
8. Using a ⅓-cup measuring cup, scoop batter onto the warm skillet, leaving a couple of inches around each pancake for expansion.
9. Cook until small bubbles form on the surface of the pancakes, 2 to 3 minutes. 
10. Flip the pancakes, then cook until lightly golden on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes more.
11. Repeat the process with the remaining batter.
12. Serve the pancakes immediately with toppings of your choosing, or keep them warm in a 200 degree Fahrenheit oven.
13. Leftover pancakes can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or frozen* for up to 2 months. To reheat, stack leftover pancakes and wrap them in a paper towel before gently reheating in the microwave.
